# Technical debt management strategy

## Quality checks planning
For the third sprint, we decided to reserve time for quality checking before writing any new code.
For the fourth sprint, we decided to reserve time both at the beginning and at the end,
so as to have the best quality possible before the end of the project.

## Technical debt repayment
Our priority is to have at least a B grade for each category, focusing first on
higher severity issues (and then proceeding downwards). 
If two categories have the same grade (lower than B), priority
is given to the shortest one. 

Code quality tasks will be estimated roughly 30%-50% less than what SonarCloud suggests.
These tasks will be assigned based on an equal time division between the group members.
